# AI Photo Editor
In this project, we aim to build a web app that allows us to perform image segmentation via [SAM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/sam) and inpaint the segmented foreground or background via [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1). The web app interface is created utilizing [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).

## Quick Start
- The [conda environment file](AI_editor.yml) is provided for installing the relevant packages needed to run the [notebook](AI_PhotoEditor.ipynb).

## Project Details
### App Instructions
- After conda environment installation, run the required parts of the [notebook](AI_PhotoEditor.ipynb) as per the comments in the markdown cells. 
- Click on the public URL, as instructed in "Interactive app" cell, to open the app on your browser.
- Demo of how to use the app can be seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/UG0YdPsSHsY?si=31t4-q-iVCnD76e8).  

### Example Results
- Some of the AI edited photos are shown by taking screenshots of the app with associated prompts and input images in the [folder](./Output_screenshots/).
